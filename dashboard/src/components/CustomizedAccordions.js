			The detection of harmful packages is the initial step of analysis. A list of malicious packages from our dataset is compared to the retrieved package. The APK file is labeled as malicious if the extracted package is on the list.

            Finding harmful permissions is the second step of examination. A list of malicious permissions from our dataset is compared to the retrieved permissions. The application administrator privileges are provided by these permissions. If at least one of the retrieved permissions appears in the dataset list, the APK file is flagged as malicious.

            The detection of suspicious permission combinations constitutes the third stage of examination. The extracted permissions are contrasted with a list of permission combinations from our dataset. The APK file is labeled as malicious if at least one combination from the dataset is a subset of the retrieved permissions.
