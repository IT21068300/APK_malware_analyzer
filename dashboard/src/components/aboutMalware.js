                            APK files (Android Application Package) can be susceptible to various types of malware that can harm your device and compromise your privacy. Here are some common types of malware that can be found in APK files:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <span className={classes.span}>Trojan Horse</span> Trojans are a prevalent form of malware in APK files. They disguise themselves as legitimate applications but contain malicious code that can perform unauthorized actions on your device. Trojans can steal personal information, log keystrokes, take control of your device, or create a backdoor for remote access by attackers.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span className={classes.span}>Adware</span> Adware is a type of malware that displays unwanted advertisements on your device. It can be bundled with legitimate apps or hidden within APK files. Adware generates revenue for attackers by delivering intrusive ads, collecting user data, and impacting device performance.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span className={classes.span}>Spyware:</span> Spyware is designed to secretly monitor your activities and collect sensitive information such as login credentials, browsing habits, or personal data. It can be embedded in APK files, allowing attackers to track your actions, steal personal information, or conduct surveillance without your knowledge.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span className={classes.span}>Ransomware</span>  Ransomware is a malicious software that encrypts your files and demands a ransom to provide the decryption key. While ransomware is more commonly associated with desktop systems, it can also infect Android devices through APK files. Once infected, your files may become inaccessible until the ransom is paid.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span className={classes.span}>Rootkit</span> Rootkits are designed to gain root access or administrative privileges on your device, giving attackers complete control. They can be hidden within APK files and exploit vulnerabilities in the Android operating system to gain persistent access, making it difficult to detect and remove them.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span className={classes.span}>Botnets</span> Some APK files may contain malware that can turn your device into a part of a botnet—a network of compromised devices controlled by attackers. Botnets can be used to launch coordinated attacks, distribute spam, conduct distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, or perform other malicious activities.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span className={classes.span}>Malvertising</span> APK files obtained from untrusted sources may contain malvertisements—malicious advertisements. These ads can redirect you to phishing websites, download additional malware, or exploit vulnerabilities in your device or apps.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span className={classes.span}>Cryptojacking</span> Cryptojacking involves the unauthorized use of your device's resources, such as processing power or electricity, to mine cryptocurrencies. APK files with cryptojacking malware can silently initiate mining operations, which can slow down your device, increase power consumption, and potentially cause hardware damage.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
